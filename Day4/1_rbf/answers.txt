rbf - execution time:

python: 5.86 s
scipy: 0.11 s


profiling:

rbf_network spends 55.5% of its time in line 17, r += ..., inside triple loop. Vectorizing the code and getting rid of at least 1-2 loops would certainly improve the performance.

Cython implementation - execution time:

cython: 0.36 s
